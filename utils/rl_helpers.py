Reinforcement Learning Helpers (Simplified for Contextual Bandit)
==================================================================

Essential utilities for bandit-based adaptive learning:
- State discretization (convert continuous metrics to discrete states)
- Reward calculation (simple score improvement signal)

Features:
- No temporal difference (no next_state dependency)
- Running average of rewards per (state, action)
- Simple, interpretable reward signal
